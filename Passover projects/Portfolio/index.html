              Almost a decade ago I was busy teaching math to teenagers at three
              schools in London and Cambridge. Since I’m a bit of a coding geek,
              I also built websites on the side for friends and family. I soon
              learned that web development was a very lucrative career choice,
              so I gave up my successful (and sometimes stressful) job as a
              teacher to build websites. Today, I couldn’t be happier with that
              decision. After building websites for about seven years, I noticed
              a lot of people struggling to learn how to code. I wanted others
              to have the same freedoms that I enjoyed, so I started teaching
              web development I'm familiar with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP7
              and MySQL. Checkout some of the projects I've done below.
